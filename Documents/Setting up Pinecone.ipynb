Somelanguagesareverygoodforbeginners .\\nThey hold your hand and make programming super easy. We can go\\nto the extreme and look at visual languages such as Scratch.\\nIn Scratch, you get blocks that represent programming concepts like\\nvariables,loops,methodcalls,andsoon,andyoudraganddro pthem\\non a visual surface.

Me too, because that would be insanity.\\nOther languages are incredibly powerful for expert develope rs. The\\nmost popular one in this category is likely C++ and its close re lative,\\nC.

You nailed it: C/C++.\\nYou can do amazing things with these languages, but they are wholl y\\nunwelcoming to newcomers looking for a gentle introduction .\\nYou might not have read a lot of C++ code. It can almost make your\\neyes burn. Here’s an example, a real albeit complex one:\\ntemplate <typename T>\\n_Defer<void(*(PID<T>, void (T::*)(void)))\\n(const PID<T>&, void (T::*)(void))>\\ndefer(const PID<T>& pid, void (T::*method)(void))\\n{\\nvoid (*dispatch)(const PID<T>&, void (T::*)(void)) =\\n&process::template dispatch<T>;\\nreturn std::tr1::bind(dispatch, pid, method);\\n}\\nPlease, just no.\\nBoth Scratch and C++ are decidedly notwhat I would call full-\\nspectrum languages. With Scratch, it’s easy to start, but you ha ve to\\nswitchtoa“real”languagetobuildrealapplications. Conv ersely,you\\ncan build real apps with C++, but there’s no gentle on-ramp.

In this system, you capitalize the ﬁrst letter\\nof every word except the ﬁrst and leave all other letters in lowe rcase.\\nFor example, numStudents and listOfNames are written in mixedCase.\\nIn Python, however, it’s more common to write variable names in\\nlower_case_with_underscores . In this system, you leave every\\nletter in lowercase and separate each word with an underscor e. For\\ninstance, both num_students and list_of_names are written using the\\nlower_case_with_underscores system.\\nThere’s no rule mandating that you write your variable names in\\nlower_case_with_underscores.

If\\nyou need to keep the result, then you need to assign it to a variab le:\\n>>> name =\"Picard\"\\n>>> name =name.upper()\\n>>> name\\n\\'PICARD\\'\\nname.upper() returns a new string \"PICARD\", which is reassigned to the\\nnamevariable. This overrides theoriginalstring \"Picard\" thatyouﬁrst\\nassigned to name.\\n83'), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs\\\\python-basics-sample-chapters.pdf', 'page': 84}, page_content='4.3. Manipulate Strings With Methods\\nUseIDLEtoDiscoverAdditionalStringMethods\\nStrings have lots of methods associated with them, and the methods\\nintroduced in this section barely scratch the surface. IDLE ca n help\\nyou ﬁnd new string methods. To see how, ﬁrst assign a string lite ral\\nto a variable in the interactive window:\\n>>> starship =\"Enterprise\"\\nNext, type starship followed by a period, but do not hit Enter. You\\nshould see the following in the interactive window:\\n>>> starship.\\nNow wait for a couple of seconds. IDLE displays a list of every string\\nmethod, which you can scroll through using the arrow keys.\\nA related shortcut in IDLE is the ability to use Tabto automatically\\nﬁll in text without having to type long names. For instance, if y ou\\ntypeonly starship.u andhit Tab,thenIDLEautomaticallyﬁllsin star-\\nship.upper because only one method that begins with a ubelongs to\\nstarship.\\nThis even works with variable names. Try typing just the ﬁrst few let-\\nters of starship and pressing Tab. If you haven’t deﬁned any other\\nnames that share those ﬁrst letters, then IDLE completes the name\\nstarship for you.\\nReviewExercises\\nYou can пnd the solutions to these exercises and many other bo nus\\nresources online at realpython.com/python-basics/resources\\n1.

McGlynn \\nMaria Nieto-Santisteban \\nIntroduction \\nThis chapter provides a very brief introduction to the Structured Query Language \\n(SQL) for getting information from relational databases. We make no pretense that \\nthis is a complete or comprehensive discussion of SQL. There are many aspects of \\nthe language the will be completely ignored in the presentation. The goal here is to \\nprovide enough background so that users understand the basic concepts involved in \\nbuilding and using relational databases. We also go through the steps involved in \\nbuilding a particular astronomical database used in some of the other presentations in \\nthis volume. \\n1. What is SQL? \\nThe Structured Query Language (SQL) is a language which describes how to create, \\nupdate and query relational databases. A relational database is conceptually quite \\nsimple. The basic elements of the relational database are simple tables of the kind we \\nsee commonly in both scientific and everyday publications. \\nTable 1. Pets \\nWe have an example table above. The table has a name (\"Pets\") and a rectangular \\narray of information. At the top of each column we have a column name, \"Owner\", \\n\"Pet Name\" and \"Pet Type\". The information within a column is of the same type - \\nwe would know there was something wrong if \"Fred\" showed up in the \"Pet Type\" \\ncolumn. \\nEach row after the headers gives information about a single pet. Apparently Fred has \\ntwo pets and Tom has none. '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs\\\\SQL chapter 1.pdf', 'page': 1}, page_content=\"2 Authov(s) Last Name($ \\nTables can be visualized in just this way in a relational database. A table is given a \\nname and has columns which each have a type - where the types are the integers or \\nfloating point numbers or strings. [An object-relational database allows the user to \\ndefine new data types and put them in the database. Most relational databases provide \\nfor some special types, e.g., money and dates but these are not typically much used in \\nastronomical databases.] Each row in the table provides information about some en- \\ntity. \\nIn addition to a mechanism for defining base tables, relational databases provided \\nmechanisms which allow a user to 'query' a tables. We could ask how many dogs or \\ncats were pets. The real power of relational database is evident when we have more \\nthan one table. E.g., suppose we also had a table \\nTable 2. Veterinarians \\nAllen \\nAllen \\nWeller Fish \\nJohnson Horses \\n/ Johnson 1 Dogs ] \\nWith just this simple pair of tables there are lots of questions we can ask: Who can \\ntreat Spike? Are there any vets that cannot treat aniof the pets? Are there any pets \\nwho must go without veterinary care? How many pets can Dr Allen treat? SQL \\nmakes it easy to combine tables and get information out of them. \\nIn the past decade astronomy has seen publication of many very large tables with \\nmore than 10' objects in them. SQL is a natural framework for mining these re- \\nsources. The Virtual Observatory has developed a general framework for providing \\nrelational databases on-line and performing queries that involve tables from one or \\nmore database. These SkyAJodes are discussed elsewhere in this volume. \\nIn the next section we will build an astronomical table using SQL statements. Sec- \\ntion 3 shows how we can make interesting astronomical queries using SQL on this \\ndatabase. \\nIn this chapter we shall assume use of the freely available MySQL database system \\nfor building and querying the table. Normally databases are concealed under layers \\nof user interfaces, so both the queries and results may seem a bit crude, but this low \\nlevel approach helps illustrate what's possible with relational databases. \\n2. Building a database \\nWe are going to build a database consisting of three tables. These tables were part of \\nthe [ref. ..I who created a table of Spectroscopic Properties of Cools Stars and a com- \\nparison table from [I Santos [...I. We create two tables for the SPOCS database. The \\ninformation is split into the xxx table and the yyy table. We will run a series of \\ncommands. These are found in the software distribution in the \\n$NVOSS/sql/mySQL/spocs directory. If you have installed MySQL you should be \\nable to run the commands exactly as shown below from the command line (modulo \\nthe changes between Windows and Unix-like environments). If you are using an- \\nother database you will need to modify the examples somewhat, but the basic out- \"), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs\\\\SQL chapter 1.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content=\"Shortened Title of Chapter in Mixed Case Type 3 \\nlines should remain the same. We assume that you have started the MySQL CLI and \\nare at the MySQL prompt. \\n2.1. Creating a name space. \\nSince there may be many different users and uses of a given relational database sys- \\ntem installation, most systems support a way to group related tables. A group of ta- \\nbles is called a 'database'. While this is rather conhsing terminology, these databases \\nare essentially just independent names spaces. A user of a database system selects the \\ncurrent default database using a system dependent command. [In the MySQL CLI the \\nUSE command selects the current database. When accessing a database through a \\nJDBC connection, the JDBC URL indicates the chosen database.] \\nGenerally tables in other databases can still be accessed and used, they just have to \\nhave the database name prefixed to the table name. \\nCREATE DATABASE database-name \\ncreates a database with the given name. Nonnally database names must be \\nunique within the database system. Example: \\ncreate database SPOCS; \\nTo get rid of a database just \\nDROP DATABASE database-name \\n2.2. Creating a table \\nThe command to create a table is simply \\nCREATE TABLE tablename (name1 typel, name2 type2, . . . ) \\nIn addition to specifying whether a the type of a field, the column definition can indi- \\ncate whether this column must be specified. SQL supports a special value, 'null', that \\nindicates that this field has not been filled for this row. A column that allows null \\nvalues is 'nullable'. It may not make sense for a column to allow nulls and the phrase \\n'not null' can be added to the type when that is the case. \\nTo create a table of bank transactions we might have \\ncreate table bankTransfer (transaction long not null, \\nsrcAccount int not null, \\ndstAccount int not null, \\namountInPennies int not null, \\ncomment varchar64); \\nThis definition ensures that each record must have all essential data, but allows an \\noptional comment of up to 64 characters. \\nTo get rid of table \\nDROP TABLE tableName \\n2.3. Adding rows to a table \\nThe INSERT command is used to add a row to a database. This simplest syntax for \\nthis command is \\nINSERT INTO tableName VALUES(val1, va12, va13 ... ) \\nwhere vall, va12, ... are the values for the row in the in same order as specified in the \\ncreate table command. If a string is being inserted, it should be enclosed in single \\nquotes. E.g., \"), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs\\\\SQL chapter 1.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content=\"4 Author(s) Last Name(s) \\ninsert into bankTransfer \\nvalues(1111002, 10030001, 10030002, 390000, \\n'Transfer checking to savings'); \\ninsert into bankTransfer \\nvalues(1111003, 96300206, 10030002, 141117, null); \\nadds two rows to the bankTransfer table where there is no comment for the second \\nrow. \\nOne can also add a row and only specify some of the columns (in any order). E.g., the \\nsecond insert above could have been specified as \\ninsert into bankTransfer \\n(transaction, dstAccount, srcAccount, amountInPennies) \\nvalues (1111003, 10030002, 96300206, 141117); \\nThe following should give an error if we try it: \\ninsert into bankTransfer \\n(toAccount, srcAccount, amountInPennies) \\nvalues(10030002, 96300206, 141117); \\nWe have to specify all the non-nullable fields in the insert. \\nWe delete records using the DELETE command, described below. \\n2.4. Creating the SPOCS and SANTOS tables. \\nTo create the SPOCS and Santos tables we run run the build-all.sq1 script. This cre- \\nates the tables, and then inserts all of the data into them. Let's take a look: \\nCreate the database we are going to work in. \\ncreate database SPOCS; \\nuse SPOCS; \\n\\\\. schema.sq1 \\n\\\\. spocs-build.sq1 \\n\\\\. spocs-ext-build.sq1 \\n\\\\. santos-build.sq1 \\nThis script just laads a series of other scripts that define and populate the tables. \\nThe schema.sq1 file defines the structure of the tables. It looks like: \\nDROP DATABASE IF EXISTS SPOCS; \\nCREATE DATABASE SPOCS; \\nUSE SPOCS; \\nCREATE TABLE spocs (ID smallint not null, \\nName varchar(20) not null, \\nTeff smallint DEFAULT null, \\nlogg double DEFAULT null, \\nMetal double DEFAULT null, \\nNa double DEFAULT null, \\nSi double DEFAULT null, \\nTi double DEFAULT null, \\n. . . \\nCONSTRAINT PRIMARY KEY (id) \\n1 ; \\nThere are a few MySQL specific additions here. The IF EXISTS in the DROP \\nDATABASE is one such. Many database systems, including MySQL, provide for a \\nUSE command. That indicates that by default all tables are to be found in the speci- \\nfied database. The CONSTRAINT at the end of the CREATE command teIls the database \"), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs\\\\SQL chapter 1.pdf', 'page': 4}, page_content=\"Shortened Title of Chapter in Mixed Case Type 5 \\nhow to organize the table. How this is done varies a fair bit from database to data- \\nbase and we could have left this out. It just makes some queries run faster. \\nThe next three files load each of the tables. They are just a series of INSERT state- \\nments.. The first few lines of spocs-build. sql are \\ninsert into spocs values(0,'Sun',5770,4.44,0.00,0.00, ... \\ninsert into spocs values(l,'HD225261f,5265,4.59,-0.31, ... \\ninsert into spocs values(2,'HD105',6126,4.65,-0.0, ... \\ninsert into spocs values(3,'HD142',6249,4.19,0.08, ... \\n. . . \\nWe are not quite done ... The positional information in the SPOCS table is encoded in \\nsexagesimal form. It is much more convenient to be able to manipulate real numbers, \\nso we may wish to add RA and Dec columns to the SPOCS database. The addcol- \\numns . sql adds two columns to the database: \\nuse SPOCS; \\nalter table spocs add ra double precision; \\nalter table spocs add 'dec' double precision; \\nwhile fillcolumns. sql fills the new columns: \\nuse SPOCS; \\nupdate spocs s, spocs-ext e \\nset s.ra = 15*(e.RAh+e.RAm/60.+e.RAs/3600.) \\nwhere s.ID = e.ID; \\nupdate spocs s, spocs-ext e \\nset s.dec = e.DEd + e.DEm/GO. + e.DEs/3600. \\nwhere e.DEd >= 0 and s.ID = e.ID; \\nupdate spocs s, spocs-ext e \\nset s.dec = e.DEd - e.DEm/GO. - e.DEs/3600. \\nwhere e.DEd < 0 and s.ID = e.ID; \\nWe will not discuss the alter table and update commands beyond these examples \\nsince they will rarely be needed by typical users. The update uses some advanced \\nfeatures, joins, table prefixes and a where clause that are described below in the dis- \\ncussion of the SELECT statement. These commands do illustrate how tables in rela- \\ntional databases are quite flexible and can be easily changed after they are created. \\nOne special MySQL issue. Note the backticks around the dec field in the second \\nalter table. MySQL treats dec by itself as a reserved word (short for decimal, a data \\ntype). The backticks allow us to use such reserved words as column names. There is \\nno problem refemng to dec as a column when it is preceded by a table prefix. It is \\nquite natural to use dec as a column name for the declination, but if you get mysteri- \\nous syntax errors in MySQL this is one possible cause. \\n3. Querying a Database \\nWhile most astronomers have only limited interest in build tables in relational data- \\nbases, getting information out of them is a different story. The SQL SELECT state- \\nment is used to query tables and get information out of them. SELECTS can be sim- \\nple or quite complex. We will discuss only a few of the simpler features of the select. \\n3.1. A simple select example \\nConsider the bankTransfer table we described in section 2.3. Suppose we want to \\nfind all of the transfers of more than $1000. The SELECT statement might look like \"), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs\\\\SQL chapter 1.pdf', 'page': 5}, page_content='6 Author(s) Last Name(s) \\nselect transaction, toAccount amount1nPennies/100. \\nfrom bankTransfer \\nwhere amountInPennies > 100000 \\norder by toAccount,amountInPennies \\nMany simple select statements have the form \\nSELECT selectionList FROM tablelist WHERE condition ORDER BY fields \\nHere the selectionList is the list of columns that we want to get out. It can include \\ncolumns in the original table or expressions involving those columns, or even con- \\nstants. \\nThe table list is the set of tables we are querying. In our example there is just one \\ntable. In addition to the name of the table, an alias for the table (often just one or two \\nletters) can be given for each table, e.g., in . . . from bankTransfer bt, account- \\nDetails ad . . . We have an alias, bt, for the bankTransfer table. \\nIn queries where more than one table is used, the name of a column may be ambigu- \\nous: a column of that name may be present in more than one table. The name of the \\ntable or more commonly the table alias may be prefixed to the column name to make \\nit clear which table each column belongs to. ADQL, the dialect of SQL used in the \\nVirtual Observatory SkyNodes requires that an alias be used whenever a column is \\nspecified in a query. The query above would need to be written as \\nselect bt.transaction, bt.toAccount bt.amountInPennies/lOO. \\nfrom bankTransfer bt \\nwhere bt.amountInPennies > 100000 \\norder by bt.toAccount,bt.amountInPennies \\nThe order by clause specifies the order in which the results will be displayed. \\nUnless this clause is present the order of results is undefined and is not guaranteed to \\nbe the same even for two identical fields. One or more fields may be specified (ex- \\npressions can also be used) and the results are ordered by the first element. If this is \\nequal for two rows then the second element is used to break the tie and so forth. The \\nkeywords \"ASC\" or \"DESC\" can be appended to an element to specify the direction \\nof the sort. ASC is the default. \\nThe where clause determines which rows are to be output. In our example we have a \\nvery simple where clause with a single criterion. Any number of criteria can be put \\ntogether using logical operators AND, OR and NOT. \\n3.2. Filters and joins. \\nConceptually the criteria that show up in the where clause can be separated as filters \\nand joins. Filters simply get rid of some of the available rows. For example the cri- \\nterion we used above bt . amount ~n~ennies > 10 o 00 o filters the rows in the bank- \\nTransfer table and returns only a subset of these. Any number of filters can be \\nplaced on a table and they may involve expressions. If a table has B and V magni- \\ntudes for stars and we only want to consider stars with a particular color we might \\nuse bmag-mag > 1 and bmag-vmag < 1.5 (or equivalently bmag-mag between \\n1 and 1.5). \\nFor the dialect of SQL used in the Virtual Observatory, joins between tables are also \\nspecified in the where clause. When more than one table is specified in the table list \\nfor the query, the query is performed on the cross-product of the two tables. E.g., if \\none table has 30 rows and a second 20, then there are potentially 600 rows in a query \\nthat involves both of them. Normally for each row in the first table we only want to '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs\\\\SQL chapter 1.pdf', 'page': 6}, page_content='Shortened Title of Chapter in Mixed Case Type 7 \\nconsider some small subset of the second. E.g., if we are doing a query that involves \\nbank transfers and bank accounts, then for each transfer we probably only want to \\nlook at the accounts involved in that transfer - not every account in the system. We \\nmight have a query like \\nselect acct.narne,acct.address,bt.amountInPennies \\nfrom bankAccount acct, bankTransfer bt \\nwhere bt.amount1nPennies > 100000 and \\nacct.id = bt.toAccount \\nwhere we have an account table with the account holders name and address and their \\naccount number for each account in the system. There are two criteria in the where \\nclause. The first is our familiar filter. We are only interested in transaction above \\n$1000. The second says that for each transaction, find the row in the account table \\nwhich has the name and address for the account to which the money is being trans- \\nferred. \\nThere are other ways of specifying joins in most modem dialects of SQL (using a \\nJOIN field in the FROM clause), but the effect is the same. \\nPerhaps the most common join for astronomers is to find rows in two tables where \\nthe objects are close to each other in the sky, spatial cross-correlations. Which it is \\neasy to handle proximity in one dimension in standard SQL, doing matches on the \\nsky for large databases often requires special handling. For smaller databases (e.g., \\nless than a million rows), it is usually reasonably fast to just use standard geometric \\nexpressions. These may seem clumsy expressed in SQL, but databases are typically \\nI/O bound so that evaluating complex expressions may have no effect on the actual \\nquery time. The issues involved in doing spatial joins are discussed in the [building a \\nskynode server]. \\n4. Querying the SPOCS database \\nIn this section we will do a series of queries of the SPOCS database we created in \\nsection 2. Each of these queries is available as file in the software distribution. \\n4.1. Find analogs to the sun. \\nThe Sun has a temperature of Tef~5770 K and a gravity of log(g)=4.4 and a metallic- \\nity of [M/H]=O.O. Stars like the Sun will have values of these three parameters similar \\nto the solar values. To look for stars with temperatures within 50 K of the Sun and \\nsimilar gravities and metallicities we have \\nSELECT s.ID, s.Name, s.Teff, s.Logg, s.Metal \\nFROM spocs s \\nWHERE s.Teff BETWEEN 5720 AND 5820 AND \\ns.Logg BETWEEN 4.34 AND 4.54 AND \\ns.Metal BETWEEN -0.1 AND +0.1 \\nORDER BY s.Teff; -- queryl.sq1 \\n4.2. Look for systematic trends vs temperatures. \\nMaking a star a little bit cooler, reducing the gravity a little bit, or increasing the met- \\nallicity a little bit all tend to make spectral lines a little bit deeper. This unfortunate \\nreality makes it hard to get the temperature, gravity, and metallicity exactly correct. '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs\\\\SQL chapter 1.pdf', 'page': 7}, page_content=\"8 Author(s) Last Name@) \\nWhen astronomers measure gravity, any error the temperature or metallicity will \\ncause a compensating error in gravity. Similarly, when measuring metallicity, any \\nerror in temperature and gravity will cause a compensating error in metallicity. All \\nthree parameters are interlinked.* Detecting and characterizing systematic errors can \\nbe difficult. \\nHere we compare stellar parameters fiom two different spectroscopists, using differ- \\nent analysis techniques. Ordering the differences as a function of increasing tempera- \\nture shows trends. The size of these trends may give a sense of the systematic errors \\nin the results. \\nSELECT s.ID, s.Name, s.Teff, \\n(s.Teff - e.Teff) as dTeff, s.Logg, \\nformat(s.Logg - e.Logg,Z) as dLogg, s.Fe, \\nformat(s.Fe - e.Fe,2) as dFe \\nFROM spocs s, santos e \\nWHERE substring(s.Name,3) = trim(e.HD) \\nORDER BY s.Teff; -- Query 3 \\nThis query uses special functions in the database to make the results look pretty and \\nalso shows how we may need to be careful when we do joins. We are querying both \\nthe SPOCS and Santos tables. The SPOCS and Santos table both have the HD num- \\nber of the stars as columns, but in the SPOCS table they are found in the name col- \\numn prefixed with the string 'HD '. So we need to use string manipulation function to \\nmatch the columns. We also use the MySQL format function to make the output \\nlook nicer with just two digits to the right of the decimal point for the computed \\nquantities. These calls could be omitted. \\nIf you are careful you may have noted that the computed columns were given names, \\nfor example in (s . Tef f - e . Tef f ) as dTef f. This is standard SQL. One can \\nchange the names of columns, or assign names to expressions in the output. \\nThis query gives us a table of all of the HD objects included in both the SPOCS and \\nSantos tables and gives the difference in measured temperature and gravity. The re- \\nsults are ordered by temperature as measured in SPOCS. The output of this query \\ncan be plotted or analyzed statistically. \\n4.3. Is there a systematic difference between the 2 catalogs? \\nIn the previous query we found the individual differences between measurements in \\nSPOCS and Santos. Using aggregate functions we can do overall statistics as well. \\nSELECT format(avg (s.Teff - e.Teff), 1) as mean-dTeff, \\nformat(avg(s.Logg - e.Logg), 3) as mean-dLogg, \\nformat (avg (s . Fe - e. Fe) , 3) as mean-dFe \\nFROM spocs s, santos e \\nWHERE substring (s .Name, 3) = trim(e. HD) ; (Query 10) \\nAggregate functions take a set of rows and compute an aggregate quantity. The most \\ncommon functions are AVG, MIN, MAX and COUNT. If the SELECT statement \\nhas no GROUP BY clause, then only one row will be output. However you can do \\naggregates for subsets of the table. E.g., the query \\nSELECT s.ID, s.Name, count(e.HD) as c \\nFROM spocs s, santos e \"), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs\\\\SQL chapter 1.pdf', 'page': 8}, page_content=\"Shortened Title of Chapter in Mixed Case Type \\nWHERE substring (s .Name, 3) = trim(e.HD) \\nGROUP BY s . ID, s .Name \\nORDER BY c desc; (Query 4) \\nlooks for the matching stars in the SPOCS and Santos catalogs and finds how many \\nenties there are in the Santos catalog for each one. In a number of cases there are \\nmultiple entries in the Santos catalog. \\nGrouping is one of many advanced capabilities for queries in SQL. Subselects, \\nEXISTS and IN qualifiers, autocorrelations are just a few of the features that are dis- \\ncussed in more comprehensives treatments of SQL queries. Our goal here has been \\nto give a sense of how SQL can be used to extract interesting astronomical infonna- \\ntion &om databases. \\n5. Astronomical SQL databases on the Web. \\nIn addition to the Virtual Observatory SkyNode resources discussed elsewhere in this \\nvolume there are a number of astronomical databases that support SQL queries. \\nThe Sloan Digital Sky Survey - SDSS at http:llskyserver.sdss.org \\nGalaxy Evolution Explorer - Galex at-http://galex.stsci.edu/ \\nSuperCOSMOS Science Archive - SSA at http://surveys.roe.ac .uW \\nTo use any relational database you will need to understand the meanings of the tables \\nand the columns it comprises. Either the documentation or on-line tools should give \\nyou a overview of the schema of the database. You can then build increasingly com- \\nplex queries to build familiarity with the database and its response. For large data- \\nbases it is very easy to run queries that require large resources of either storage or \\ncompute time to complete. Normally through the Web you will be limited to queries \\nthat return no more than a few thousands of rows and take no more than several min- \\nutes to complete. The precise policies will vary fi-om site to site. \\n6. What's Left? \\nThis introduction to SQL has left many areas of the language entirely unexplored. \\nDesigning databases requires careful understanding of the roles and relationships be- \\ntween the tables. How should tables be joined? How does one define a unique row \\nof a table? Which datatypes should be used? Building databases is a real art. \\nFor the large astronomical databases coming online building efficient indexes for \\nspatial queries is a major issue. Often special columns are included in the database \\npurely to maximize the efficiency of some searches. \\nSQL has a whole host of features to insure that databases can be built robustly. There \\nare features to ensure transactional integrity where consistency can be maintained \\neven when there is a problem in the middle of a sequence of updates. Other SQL \\nfeatures can be used to ensure that table columns never violate constraints that the \\nusers wish to specify. \\nThere are many of capabilities available in queries that we have not described: subse- \\nlects, GROUP BY and HAVING clauses, a myriad of functions to manipulate num- \\nbers, strings and other types. \\nThe SQL standard describes a framework for metadata about tables though the qual- \\nity of the implementation varies from system to system. \"), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs\\\\SQL chapter 1.pdf', 'page': 9}, page_content='I0 Author(s) Last Narne(s) \\nThere are commonly used but non-standard extensions to SQL. Users can create ta- \\nbles directly from queries. Temporary tables that disappear automatically when a \\nsession is complete are usually supported. \\nFor low level access, users need to be aware of the differences between SQL imple- \\nmentations by different vendors. These differences range from such basic issues as \\nhow an SQL statement is terminated, to what metadata is available. \\n7. Further information \\nThere are many books available on SQL. A few are described at \\nhttp://databases.about.com/cs/sql/tp/sqlbooks.htm. There are also many on-line re- \\nsources. \\n7.1.
